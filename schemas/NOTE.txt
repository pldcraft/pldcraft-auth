I'm just providing these schemas to make it easier for you to start up with SQLite.

If you want to run this on MySQL or Postgres, you're probably going to need to write
your own (mostly compatible) schemas.

You should probably make sure all the unique constraints that exist here also exist
on whatever database you are using.
